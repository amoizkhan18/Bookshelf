      'Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is a self-help book first published in 1937. Arguably one of the most famous and well-known books on self-improvement, the book has sold over 15 million copies. Inspired by wealthy businessman Andrew Carnegie, Think and Grow Rich was published during the Great Depression and contains the philosophy of rich people and how they made their wealth. A lot of the book comes down to the concept of perseverance and believing in yourself. Hill claimed that this book was the result of more than twenty years of studying the habits of people who had gained wealth - and from that study, he devised sixteen laws that need to be applied to achieve success. The book takes those laws, and puts them into fourteen principles that the reader can develop. Along with basic advice such as treating your customers well, etc, Hill also tells us that we need to grow spiritually as well, and towards the end of the book, he delves into some esoteric subjects such as Kundalini energy, manifesting psychic powers, and tapping into your higher consciousnes. The book, after all, is called Think and Grow Rich.',

      'As a man thinketh by James Allen is a philosophical essay written in the early 20th century. This book explores the profound influence of thought on character, circumstances, health, and overall achievement in life. It emphasizes the idea that individuals are responsible for their own destinies through the thoughts they foster and maintain. The text presents a series of reflections on how thoughts shape our lives. Allen posits that our character is a direct result of our thinking patterns and that positive thoughts can lead to beneficial outcomes, while negative thoughts result in adverse circumstances. He discusses various aspects of life, including the interaction of thought with health, the importance of having a clear purpose, and the role of ideals in personal growth. Through a series of contemplative assertions, the author invites readers to recognize their power as creators of their own realities by consciously choosing their thoughts and attitudes, ultimately guiding them toward personal fulfillment and success.',

      'Sun Tzŭ on the Art of War: The Oldest Military Treatise in the World by Sunzi is a classic military treatise attributed to the ancient Chinese general and strategist, Sun Tzu, written in the 5th century BC. This work is often regarded as one of the foundational texts in military philosophy and strategy. The book emphasizes the significance of strategy over brute force in warfare and offers insights into planning, tactical maneuvers, and the psychological aspects of conflict, relevant for both military leaders and modern strategists. At the start of this treatise, the reader is introduced to fundamental concepts that begin to shape the principles of warfare articulated by Sun Tzu. The opening section outlines the critical importance of understanding the nature of warfare, emphasizing that it is a matter of life and death for the state. Sun Tzu introduces five constant factors that must be considered in military deliberations: the moral law, heaven (weather), earth (terrain), the commander, and method and discipline. He sets a tone that advocates for strategic planning and adaptability, asserting that victory is contingent upon understanding these elements and applying them effectively in command situations. The text also introduces the famous principle that "All warfare is based on deception," establishing a framework for tactical thought that will resonate throughout the subsequent chapters.',

Harker’s journey takes him to Transylvania, where he encounters the enigmatic Count Dracula, setting a thrilling and mysterious tone that delves into themes of fear, seduction, and the supernatural. The opening of the novel presents Jonathan Harker’s journal entries, marking the beginning of his travels to meet Count Dracula regarding a real estate transaction. Harker describes his train journey through the picturesque landscapes of eastern Europe, highlighting the eerie atmosphere and local superstitions that hint at the challenges he will face. Upon arriving at the Counts castle, Harker senses unease, especially when local villagers express concern and give him protective charms against evil spirits. The tension escalates as Harker meets Dracula, who, while courteous, exhibits strange and unsettling behavior. Kafkaesque and claustrophobic, the initial chapters effectively set the stage for Harkers realization that he is trapped in Dracula world, creating an eerie, suspenseful foundation for the unfolding narrative.',

      '"Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a novel written in the mid-19th century. The story delves into the psychological turmoil of its main character, Rodion Raskolnikov, a former student living in extreme poverty in St. Petersburg, as he grapples with morality, guilt, and the nature of crime. Raskolnikovs internal struggles and rationalizations set the stage for a broader exploration of existential questions and the consequences of ones choices. At the start of the novel, readers are introduced to Raskolnikov, who, on a sweltering July evening, leaves his cramped garret, fueled by a mix of fear and dread. He is acutely aware of his troubled finances, particularly his debts to his landlady, which cultivate a sense of isolation and despair. As he wanders through the citys pungent streets, he reflects on his own cowardice and impotence while contemplating a deeply disturbing act he is contemplating. The opening scene captures Raskolnikovs increasingly fraught mental state, portraying him as both an intellectual and a tormented soul. Eventually, he visits an old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, where an unsettling encounter begins to unfold, hinting at the drastic actions he is considering.',
